What is *QCxMS* ?
==================

`QCxMS` is a quantum chemical based program to calculate electron ionization (**EI**) and collision induced dissociation (**CID**) 
mass spectra using Born-Oppenheimer Molecular Dynamics (BO-MD). It is the successor of the QCEIMS program. The **EI** part 
is exchanged to ``x`` to account for a greater general applicibility of the program.  The executable can be obtained 
free-of-charge by mailing qceims@thch.uni-bonn.de

The program was originally developed for calculating EI, so it is historically gron that a lot of files obtained and used by 
the program have the historic `qceims.xxx` name. This will be corrected over time.
