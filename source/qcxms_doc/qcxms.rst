What is *QCxMS* ?
==================

`QCxMS` is a quantum chemical based program to calculate electron ionization (**EI**) and collision induced
dissociation (**CID**) mass spectra using Born-Oppenheimer Molecular Dynamics (BO-MD). 
It is the successor of the QCEIMS program, in which the **EI** part is exchanged to **x** to account 
for the greater general applicibility of the program. 

The **QCxMS** program is available and free-of-charge at the QCxMS `GitHub page <https://github.com/qcxms/QCEIMS_v.4.3/releases/tag/source>`_
