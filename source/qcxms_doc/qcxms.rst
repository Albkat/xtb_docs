What is *QCxMS* ?
==================

`QCxMS` is a quantum chemical based program to calculate electron ionization (**EI**) and collision induced
dissociation (**CID**) mass spectra using Born-Oppenheimer Molecular Dynamics (BO-MD). 
It is the successor of the QCEIMS program, in which the **EI** part is exchanged to **x** to account 
for the greater general applicibility of the program. 
However, the program is **not available** in this form, as it is under review. After publication, the program will be released.

Until then, the **QCEIMS** version 4.3 is available and free-of-charge at QCEIMS
`GitHub page <https://github.com/qcxms/QCEIMS_v.4.3/releases/tag/source>`_ 

.. note::
   The QCxMS describes the new name for QCEIMS and includes the CID features that are not yet released. 
   However, the EI mode is not influenced hereby. Until publication, QCEIMS version 4.3 the most recent 
   version of the program.
