What is *QCxMS* ?
==================

`QCxMS` is a quantum chemical based program to calculate electron ionization (**EI**) and collision induced dissociation (**CID**) 
mass spectra using Born-Oppenheimer Molecular Dynamics (BO-MD). It is the successor of the QCEIMS program, in which 
the **EI** part is exchanged to ``x`` to account for a greater general applicibility of the program. 
However, the program is **not available** in this form, as it is under review. After publication, the program will be released.
Until then, the **QCEIMS** version 4.2 is available and free-of-charge by mailing qceims@thch.uni-bonn.de
All information provided here corresponding to the *EI part* is relevant to QCEIMS. 

.. note::
   The CID mode describes experimental features that are not yet released. The EI mode is not influenced hereby.
   For this reason, QCEIMS version 4.2 is currently the most recent version available.
