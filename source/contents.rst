 An User Guide to Semiempirical Tight Binding
==============================================

This user guide focuses on the semiempirical quantum mechanical (SQM) method
which is called extended tight binding (xTB) as it is implemented in the
`xtb <https://www.chemie.uni-bonn.de/pctc/mulliken-center/software/xtb/xtb>`_ program package.

We provide a number of detailed guides dealing with common task that can
be performed easily with the ``xtb`` program.
All guides are usually structured the same way, starting with some simple
examples using only the commandline and the default settings followed
by a trouble shooting section.
Detailed inputs are provided in a ready to use fashion to solve some
more special but still common tasks with ``xtb`` together with some
insights into the theory used behind the scences.
